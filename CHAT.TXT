chat v1.0 : by dink (dink@r0x.com / http://www.r0x.com/~dink)

- disclaimer -
bleh.  if this program screws up something, and you come complaining to me;
i will find you, and i will kill you.

- info -
this program will let you have a little 'chatter' thinggy on your system.
just run chat.exe with a number of your choice, then telnet to it.
(and have your friends telnet to it!! :)

example: chat.exe 1234
then telnet to yoursystem.com 1234

- extra -
i got bored the other day, so i deceided to write something, and this was
born.  i also included the source code in case you are curious.
sorry, but i can not give out the 'sock' unit.  if you really need
a tcp/ip unit for virtual pascal/2, head on over to:
